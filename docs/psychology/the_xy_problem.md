[The XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) is a communication
or thinking problem encountered in situations where the real issue,
*X*, of the human asking for help is obscured, because instead of asking directly
about issue *X*, they ask how to solve a secondary issue, *Y*, which they believe
will allow them to resolve issue *X*. However, resolving issue *Y* often does not
resolve issue *X*, or is a poor way to resolve it, and the obscuring of the real
issue and the introduction of the potentially strange secondary issue can lead
to the person trying to help having unnecessary difficulties in communication
and offering poor solutions.

# How to avoid it

* Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted
    solution.
* If someone asks for more information, do provide details.
* If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, share why you've ruled
    them out. This gives more information about your requirements.
