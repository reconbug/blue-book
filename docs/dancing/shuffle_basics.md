Shuffle steps are usually split each tempo into two phases, songs usually follow
a 4/4 structure. To differentiate the steps between tempos I'm going to use the
tempo number they come from followed by an `-and` so the structure will be:
`7-and`, `1`, `1-and`, `2`... Where the `1` is the phrase starter.

Most of the steps don't have names so I've put one that felt it fits.

To specify the relative position of body parts, I'm using an imaginary clock, so
12 means upfront, 3 our right, 6 our back and 9 our left.

* *7-and*: Both legs straight under our body, right leg lifted up
    with knee up front. Weight lies on the left foot.
* *1*: Right foot kicks forward, left foot slides backward, in a way that each travel the
    same distance. Weight is evenly shared between the feet.
* *1-and*: Right foot slides backwards, right foot goes up, knee to the front.
    Weight lies on the right foot.
* *2*: Mirrors *1*.
* *2-and*: Mirrors *1-and* and it's equal to *7-and*.

* *7-and*: Both legs straight under our body, right leg lifted up
    with knee up front. Weight lies on the left foot.
* *1*: Right foot kicks sideways towards 3, try to leave the feet at 90 degrees
    with your leg and that it doesn't wobble, so it's a clean kick. The weight
    is on the left leg's toes and it pivotes over them till it points to 10.5.
    Waist ends up turned.
* *1-and*: Right foot is retrieved till the left leg's knee, keeping the base
    parallel to the ground. Weight is on the left's leg heels and pivotes over
    them to reach the 1.5 position. Waist is straight now.
* *2*: Equal to *1*.
* *2-and*: Equal to *1-and*.
* *3*: Equal to *1*.
* *3-and*: Equal to *1-and*.
* *4*: Right foot crosses before the left one, toes touch the floor first in our
    longitudinal axes. The left foot pivots over the toes to end up pointing to
    our 11. Weight is evenly shared between the feet toes.
* *4-and*: Mirrors *7-and*.
* *5*: Mirrors *1*.
* *5-and*: Mirrors *1-and*.
* *6*: Mirrors *1*.
* *6-and*: Mirrors *1-and*.
