[Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) is a Python package for creating
beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as
necessary. It’s the “Command Line Interface Creation Kit”. It’s highly
configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.

Click has the following features:

* Arbitrary nesting of commands.
* Automatic help page generation.
* Supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime.
* Supports implementation of Unix/POSIX command line conventions.
* Supports loading values from environment variables out of the box.
* Support for prompting of custom values.
* Supports file handling out of the box.
* Comes with useful common helpers (getting terminal dimensions, ANSI colors,
    fetching direct keyboard input, screen clearing, finding config paths,
    launching apps and editors).
